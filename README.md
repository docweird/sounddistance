Distance sensing with Arduino and HC-SR04

Using a Arduino Nano (clone) to read distances using the HC-SR04 distance sensor and outputting the results (as proximity "image") on a MAX7219 based 8x8 LED matrix display.

Actual project writeup with images can be seen here:

Put the sketch (.ino) into a directory (of the same name) and load up into the Arduino compiler.
